* Use only uncompressed TGA files, with RGB (true color) images.
  Compressed images will display corrupted; indexed images
  will crash the game.
* I had to solve a naming conflict between Allegro and MikMod
  (the SAMPLE struct). It would be easier to copy mikmod.h
  and rename it struct, but since that was the one I would
  be using, I thought it made more sense to disable Allegro's
  sound system.
